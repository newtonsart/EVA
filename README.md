# EVA
**E**mbedded **V**oice **A**ssistant

I dont recommend you using it, it's very slow, and there are better alternatives.
Improvements will be apreciated, but I'll leave this code here, because I dont want it to be private or deleted...

## How to try it??
Run the following commands on the terminal:
```
cd ~/Downloads/
git clone https://github.com/lilart/EVA
cd EVA
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd EVA
python3 __main__.py
```

## Info
Voice assistant being in developement.
Since I dont have too many time and I go from project to project, I'll be updting this project maybe once a week.


## Functions
- [x] Change language
